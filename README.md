# E-Commerce-Business-Analysis-Project

## Project Overview

This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of an e-commerce business, uncovering insights on overall performance, customer demographics, product and category trends, marketing efficiency, sales channels, inventory management, and operational performance.

## Problem Statement

3. **Retention Strategy**: What are the churn patterns and how can customer retention be improved for high-value segments?
4. **Discount Optimization**: What discount levels result in the best revenue and profit performance without harming margins?
5. **Channel Efficiency**: Which sales and marketing channels yield the best performance in terms of conversion, revenue, and cost-efficiency?
6. **Geographic Focus**: Which regions and cities offer the highest returns and opportunities for expansion?

The business generated $12.4 million in revenue between 2020 and 2023, driven by a solid 33.4% year-over-year growth. Customer acquisition also showed progress, reaching 50,000 total customers with a 7% growth rate, signaling steady market expansion.

Revenue trends across **2020 to 2023** reveal some fluctuations among the three main product categories. However, **Electronics consistently led in revenue**, followed by **Beauty** and **Apparel**. This underscores the strong consumer demand for tech and personal care products.

A deeper dive into subcategories shows that **Sportswear, Computers, and Makeup** generated the highest revenue—reflecting consumer priorities around lifestyle, fitness, beauty, and technology. When it comes to profit, **Sportswear** clearly dominates, followed by **Makeup**, **Bath & Body**, **Smartphones**, **Televisions**, and **Appliances**. On the lower end of profitability, **Oral Care** stands out as an underperformer.

Demographically, the **31–50 age group** is the most valuable, accounting for **50.4% of total revenue (\$6.14M)**. The **51–80 segment** follows with **33.5%**, while the **18–30 group** contributes just **16.1%**. This pattern highlights a strong preference and purchasing power among middle-aged consumers.

Geographically, **South Dakota** ranks as the top-performing state in terms of revenue, with **New Jersey** and **Kentucky** close behind. These areas may be ripe for further investment or region-specific marketing strategies.

These insights point to clear strategic actions:

* **Double down on Electronics and Sportswear**, the leading drivers of revenue and profit.
* **Prioritize marketing to the 31–50 age group**, which delivers the highest returns.
* **Use low and mid-level discounts** to optimize sales, as these are more effective than high or no-discount approaches.
* **Re-evaluate underperforming subcategories**, such as Oral Care, for improvement or repositioning.
* **Preserve existing strengths**, particularly high customer retention and operational fulfillment efficiency.

The business is on solid footing, and with targeted strategies around demographics, product focus, and discounting, there's clear potential for sustained and scalable growth.

The e-commerce business continues to demonstrate strong financial health, generating a total profit of $3.6M and maintaining an impressive average order value (AOV) of $249. Customer loyalty is solid, with a churn rate of just 14.9%, and 85.05% of revenue ($10.37M) coming from retained customers—highlighting the platform’s effectiveness in customer engagement and satisfaction.

Demographic insights reveal a balanced revenue contribution by gender, with males slightly ahead (50.19%, $6.12M) compared to females (49.81%, $6.07M). Married customers are the top contributors by marital status, followed by single shoppers, while divorced and widowed users contribute the least—suggesting targeting opportunities based on life stage.

From a product category standpoint, Electronics leads in profitability, followed by Apparel and Beauty, aligning with sustained consumer interest in technology and lifestyle categories.

Discounting strategy proves to be a key revenue and profit lever. The low discount group outperformed all others in both revenue and profit, closely followed by mid-level discounts. In contrast, high and no-discount segments contributed minimally—indicating that moderate discounts strike the ideal balance between incentive and margin protection. Notably, 14.95% of total revenue ($1.82M) was generated by churned customers, while the vast majority—$10.37M (85.05%)—came from loyal, repeat buyers.

The e-commerce platform maintains a generally healthy customer base, with valuable insights emerging from churn and loyalty patterns across demographic segments. Although the overall churn rate is reported at 14.9%, a closer look at specific demographics reveals key opportunities for both retention and strategic targeting.

Demographic Insights: Churn and Loyalty

Age Group Dynamics:
Customers aged 31–50 exhibit the highest churn rate, closely followed by the 18–30 segment. In contrast, the 51–80 age group records the lowest churn, suggesting stronger retention among older customers—possibly due to more stable buying habits or brand loyalty.
Interestingly, the 31–50 age group also represents the largest share of loyal customers (50.48%), making them both a critical asset and a vulnerable group. The 51–80 group follows with 33.54% of loyal customers, reinforcing their value in long-term retention strategies. Meanwhile, the 18–30 group accounts for just 15.98%, indicating a need for improved engagement and tailored messaging to reduce churn among younger users.

Gender-Based Trends:
Churn rates are fairly balanced between genders, with male customers showing a slightly higher churn rate (15.16%) compared to females (14.60%). The customer base is also evenly split—50.93% male and 49.07% female—highlighting a broad gender appeal. This near parity suggests that gender-specific strategies may be less urgent than age or income-targeted initiatives, though subtle differences in behavior could still be explored for optimization.

Marital Status and Loyalty:
Married customers emerge as the most loyal, forming the largest segment of retained users. Single customers also contribute significantly to the loyal base, while Divorced and Widowed users represent a smaller share. These findings suggest that married individuals may offer more stable long-term value, potentially driven by family-related purchasing behavior or consistent lifestyle needs.

Income Group Analysis:
Income level significantly impacts customer retention. The low-income group has the highest churn rate, indicating a greater sensitivity to pricing or less brand stickiness. The mid-income group contributes the largest share of loyal customers, followed by the high-income group, which also demonstrates the lowest churn. This suggests that while price sensitivity is a challenge for lower-income segments, mid- and high-income customers offer strong potential for sustained profitability and long-term engagement.

Financial Performance by Sales Channel
The platform’s revenue and profit streams are consistently distributed across all channels—Online Store, Retail Store, Marketplace, and Mobile App.

The Online Store leads in both revenue and profit, while the Mobile App generates the least.

This channel uniformity indicates a well-diversified and stable business model, where no single channel dominates or underperforms, suggesting efficient operations and cohesive strategy execution across the board.

Customer Demographics and Loyalty
Gender Loyalty: The loyal customer base is nearly evenly split by gender, with males accounting for 50.25% and females 49.75%. This slight edge reflects inclusive engagement strategies that resonate across genders, minimizing skew and ensuring broad market appeal.

Customer Distribution by State:
Colorado has the highest customer concentration, followed by New Jersey, Idaho, South Dakota, and Rhode Island. These insights present strong opportunities for geo-targeted campaigns, warehousing optimization, and regional partnerships.

Top Revenue Cities:
South Michael, New Michael, and Lake Michael top the charts in revenue generation, reflecting urban centers with high purchasing power. These cities serve as key focal points for future promotional efforts and customer loyalty initiatives.

Product Performance
Top Profitable Products:
The standout product is “Maybelline L...”, followed by:

This diverse mix—spanning cosmetics, personal care, apparel, and electronics—reflects broad consumer interest and successful category management. These products not only drive profit but also highlight high-demand trends and brand preference.
