## Executive Summary

This e-commerce business demonstrates robust growth, with 33.4% YoY increases in both revenue and transactions, significantly outpacing customer growth of 7.00%. The business generated $3.57M in profit with an Average Order Value (AOV) of $248.61.

Apparel consistently drives the highest revenue, but Electronics emerges as the most profitable category, primarily through the dominant online channel. Within subcategories, Sportswear is the leading revenue and profit generator, with "Maybelline" and "Adidas Hoo..." being top products.

The business maintains a healthy customer retention rate, with 85.05% of total revenue ($10.37M) from non-churned customers. However, a 14.88% churn rate indicates room for improvement, particularly considering the $1.82M in revenue from churned customers. While churn is broad-based across age and income groups, loyalty is concentrated, with the 18-30 age group (50.48%) and Married customers being the most loyal segments.

Operationally, the business is efficient, with 84.76% of deliveries completed and 89.99% of orders successfully processed. Email marketing is the most effective channel, driving the highest conversions and clicks, followed by Social Media. This underscores the importance of continued investment in digital marketing over less effective traditional channels like TV and Billboards.

Demographically, "Married" customers and those with a Bachelor's degree are key revenue drivers, along with the "Mid" income group. "South Michael" is the leading revenue-generating city, and Colorado has the highest number of total customers. Interestingly, "low discount" groups generate the most revenue and profit, suggesting that moderate, strategic discounting is more effective than aggressive or no discounting.

The e-commerce business demonstrates robust growth, with YoY revenue and transaction growth at an impressive 33.4%, far outstripping customer growth of 7.00%. This suggests increased purchase frequency or higher average order values per customer.

Apparel consistently drives the highest revenue, maintaining its position as the primary sales engine from 2020 to 2023. While strong in sales, Electronics emerges as the most profitable category, primarily driven by the dominant online channel.

A healthy 85.05% ($10.37M) of total revenue comes from active, non-churned customers, indicating strong retention. However, the $1.82M from churned customers represents a clear opportunity for retention strategy improvement.

Geographically, "South Michael" leads in revenue generation, underscoring key market strengths. Demographically, "Married" customers are the top revenue contributors, highlighting a crucial segment for targeted efforts. The consistent profitability of the online channel across all categories (Electronics, Beauty, and Apparel) underscores its strategic importance.

The business is generating $3.57M in profit with an Average Order Value (AOV) of $248.61, but faces a churn rate of 14.88%.

Revenue is nearly equally split between genders, with Male customers contributing slightly more at $6.12M (50.19%) compared to Female customers at $6.07M (49.81%). The 18-30 age group drives the largest share of revenue ($6.14M, 50.4%), making them the most critical demographic.

Electronics is the most profitable category, followed by Beauty and Apparel. Within subcategories, Sportswear yields the highest profit, indicating a strong performance niche.

Interestingly, "low discount" groups generate the most revenue and profit, suggesting that aggressive discounting isn't necessary for sales volume or profitability. Conversely, the "high" and "no discount" groups contribute minimal revenue and profit. This highlights the effectiveness of strategic, moderate discounting in driving sales.

The business faces a churn rate of approximately 15%, with Male customers (15.16%) churned slightly more than Females (14.60%). All age groups show similar churn rates, hovering around the 15% mark, indicating that churn isn't concentrated in a specific age demographic. Similarly, churn rates are consistent across all income groups (Low, Mid, High), suggesting income level isn't a primary driver of churn.

In terms of loyalty, the 18-30 age group accounts for the majority of loyal customers (21K, 50.48%), significantly outnumbering other age brackets. Married customers are the largest segment of loyal customers, followed by single individuals. Furthermore, the "Mid" income group contributes the most loyal customers, highlighting their strong engagement. This suggests that while churn is broad-based, loyalty is concentrated within specific age, marital status, and income segments, offering clear targets for retention strategies.

Sportswear is the dominant revenue generator, significantly outpacing other categories like Computers and Makeup. This category's strength is further emphasized by "Maybelline" and "Adidas Hoo..." being the top two revenue-generating products overall, indicating strong brand performance within these subcategories.

Customer loyalty is evenly split between genders, with 21K loyal male and 21K loyal female customers.

From a channel perspective, Online, Retail Store, Mobile App, and Marketplace channels contribute almost equally to revenue, showing a well-diversified sales approach.

Finally, "Maybelline" not only leads in revenue but also generates the highest profit among all products, followed closely by "Dove Body" and "Adidas Hoo...", highlighting highly lucrative product lines. In terms of geographic spread, Colorado has the highest number of total customers, making it a key market.

Email marketing is the cornerstone of this business's digital strategy, consuming the highest spend while simultaneously driving the most conversions and clicks. Social Media follows as the second most effective channel, also demonstrating strong performance in terms of spend, conversions, and clicks.

In contrast, TV and Billboard campaigns show significantly lower engagement, delivering fewer conversions and clicks despite their respective spends. This suggests that while traditional advertising channels are utilized, their effectiveness in driving direct actions is notably less compared to digital counterparts. The data strongly advocates for continued investment and optimization in Email and Social Media campaigns due to their superior performance in driving user interaction and conversions.

The business is highly successful in fulfilling orders, with 84.76% of deliveries completed and an impressive 89.99% of orders successfully completed. Only a small fraction of orders are returned (1.98%) or failed (1.96%), indicating efficient operations.

Revenue is significantly driven by customers with a Bachelor's degree, who contribute the most revenue by education level. The "Mid" income group also stands out as the highest revenue generator, closely followed by the "High" income group. In terms of product categories, Electronics generates the highest revenue, surpassing Apparel and Beauty.

Finally, Married customers contribute the most revenue, followed by Single individuals, highlighting key demographic segments for revenue generation.

## Recommendations:
To sustain the current 33.4% YoY revenue and transaction growth, focus on optimizing both customer acquisition and lifetime value, especially since customer growth lags at 7.00%. Capitalize on Apparel's revenue leadership and Electronics' higher profitability by cross-promoting and investing in their respective strengths.

Address the $1.82M in revenue from churned customers by implementing targeted retention strategies, even though 85.05% of revenue comes from active customers. Leverage the strong performance of the online channel across all categories, and investigate how to improve efficiency in other channels.

Further penetrate key markets like "South Michael" and strategically target the "Married" demographic given their significant revenue contribution. Optimize discount strategies: "low discount" groups drive the most revenue and profit, suggesting that strategic, moderate discounting is more effective than aggressive or no discounting.

While churn is broad, concentrate retention efforts on the 18-30 age group, Married customers, and the "Mid" income group, as these segments exhibit the highest loyalty.

Finally, reallocate marketing spend to prioritize Email and Social Media campaigns, as they are the most effective in driving conversions and clicks, significantly outperforming TV and Billboard channels.

## Conclusion:
This e-commerce business demonstrates impressive 33.4% YoY revenue and transaction growth, underpinned by efficient operations with nearly 85% of deliveries completed and 90% of orders successfully fulfilled. Apparel leads in revenue, while Electronics drives the highest profit, both heavily reliant on the dominant online channel. Key revenue drivers include the 18-30 age group, Married customers, and those with Bachelor's degrees or in the "Mid" income bracket.

Despite a broad 15% churn rate, loyalty is concentrated within the 18-30 age group, Married customers, and the "Mid" income segment. Strategic "low discount" offerings prove most effective for revenue and profit, while Email and Social Media are the leading conversion-driving marketing channels. Addressing churn, particularly the $1.82M from lost customers, and continually refining channel and demographic targeting are key to sustaining and accelerating this strong growth trajectory.
